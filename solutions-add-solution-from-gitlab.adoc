Learn how to deploy a NetApp Kubernetes Services (NKS) Solution from a https://gitlab.com[GitLab] repository.

**Requirements**

* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.
* A Project set up and configured on your NKS account.
* An NKS cluster with Build Version: `Classic`.
* An application in a GitLab repository.
* An SSH key pair for use as the deploy key. **IMPORTANT:** Create this key pair without a passphrase.

For instructions on how to create an SSH key pair, link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[follow the instructions in this article].

If you have problems getting your Application up and running, you may need to customize your Procfile. link:solutions-customize-procfile.html[Learn more about using a Procfile.]

== Add the Solution

The first step is to add the Solution to your NKS account.

=== Select Solution Type

Click **Projects** then select the Project you want to use.

Click **+ Add Solution**. Click **Application** as the Solution type.

Select the Workspace, Cluster, and Project you want to use, then click **Next**.

=== Define Version Control

In this step you will set two items:

* NKS: The Remote URL
* GitLab: The Private Deploy Key

**Remote URL**

To get this URL, visit your project's GitLab repository page and click the blue **Clone** button.

NOTE: You must use "Clone with SSH."

Click to copy the SSH URL. Paste this in to NKS as the Remote URL.

**Private Deploy Key**

For this step you will need an SSH key pair. **IMPORTANT:** Create this key pair without a passphrase.

For more information on how to create an SSH key pair, link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[see this article].

Use caution when copying the SSH key. For instructions on how to copy the SSH key, see link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[this article].

* **Mac:** Use `pbcopy`.
* **Linux:** Use `xclip`.
* **Windows:** Use Notepad. If you have https://gitforwindows.org/[Git BASH], use the `clip` command.

Paste the **private** key into the Private Deploy Key field on NKS. You will add the **public** key to GitLab in the next section.

Click **Next** to continue.

=== Configure Application

Set the application's name, update strategy, and scaling. Click **Next** to continue.

=== Review and Confirm

Review and confirm all your settings. To change a setting, click the Edit button.

When you are sure that everything is correct, click **Create** to create the Solution. This creates your Solution and redirects you to the Application's page.

== Deploy and Update Code

Next, you will add configurations to your GitLab repository. To do this, you will give GitLab:

* The Deploy Key. This is the **public** key you created.
* The Payload URL (webhook) from NKS.
* The Webhook Secret from NKS.

=== Add the Deploy Key

Go to the GitLab page for your repository and click **Settings > Repository**.

Click to expand **Deploy keys**.

* Be sure to add the **public** (not private) SSH key.
* You do not need to enable write access.

Click **Add key** to add your Deploy key.

=== Add the Webhook

From the GitLab page for your repository, click **Settings > Integrations**.

Return to the NKS application page, where you will find the Payload URL and Webhook Secret.

image::solutions-add-gitlab-solution-deploy-code.png[Deploy the code]

Paste these in to the URL and Secret Token fields on GitLab.

* Set the event(s) you want to trigger the webhook.
* Enable SSL verification.

Click **Add webhook** to add the webhook.

=== Trigger the Webhook if Necessary

When you add your webhook, GitLab gives you a list of choices for events which trigger the webhook. By default, a repository push is the webhook trigger. If this is the case for your webhook, you will need to do a `git push` to trigger the webhook.

== Check Your Application

At this point everything is configured, although it make take a few minutes for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the process on the Solution's **Metrics** tab.

When the deployment is ready, you can view your application by visiting the ingress URL which NKS automatically created for your application.
