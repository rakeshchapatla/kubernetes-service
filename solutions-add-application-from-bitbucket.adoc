= Add an Application from Bitbucket
:imagesdir: assets/documentation/solutions/

Learn how to deploy an application on your NetApp Kubernetes Services (NKS) Solution from a https://bitbucket.org/[Bitbucket] repository.

**Requirements**

* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.
* A Project set up and configured on your NKS account.
* An NKS cluster with Build Version: `Classic`.
* An application in a Bitbucket repository.
* An SSH key pair for use as the deploy key. **IMPORTANT:** Create this key pair without a passphrase.

For instructions on how to create an SSH key pair, link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[follow the instructions in this article].

If you have problems getting your application up and running, you may need to customize your Procfile. link:solutions-customize-procfile.html[Learn more about using a Procfile.]

== Add the Application

The first step is to add the application to your NKS account.

=== Select Application Type

Click **Projects** then select the Project you want to use.

Click **+ Add Solution**. Click **Application** as the Solution type.

Select the Workspace, Cluster, and Project you want to use, then click **Next**.

=== Define Version Control

In this step you will set two items:

* NKS: The Remote URL
* Bitbucket: The Private Deploy Key

**Remote URL**

To get this URL, visit your project's Bitbucket repository page and click the **Clone** link in the upper right-hand corner.

NOTE: You must clone with SSH. If the pop-up says HTTPS, click the drop-down menu in the upper right-hand corner of the pop-up to switch to SSH.

Click to copy the SSH URL. Paste this in to NKS as the Remote URL.

**Private Deploy Key**

For this step you will need an SSH key pair. **IMPORTANT:** Create this key pair without a passphrase.

For more information on how to create an SSH key pair, link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[see this article].

Use caution when copying the SSH key. For instructions on how to copy the SSH key, see link:create-an-ssh-keypair.html[this article].

* **Mac:** Use `pbcopy`.
* **Linux:** Use `xclip`.
* **Windows:** Use Notepad. If you have https://gitforwindows.org/[Git BASH], use the `clip` command.

Paste the **private** key into the Private Deploy Key field on NKS. You will add the **public** key to BitBucket in the next section.

Click **Next** to continue.

=== Configure Application

Set the application's name, update strategy, and scaling. Click **Next** to continue.

=== Review and Confirm

Review and confirm all your settings. To change a setting, click the Edit button.

When you are sure that everything is correct, click **Create** to create the Solution. This creates your Solution and redirects you to the Application's page.

== Deploy and Update Code

Next, you will add configurations to your Bitbucket repository. To do this, you will give Bitbucket:

* The Deploy Key. This is the **public** key you created.
* The Payload URL (webhook) from NKS.

=== Add the Deploy Key

Go to the Bitbucket page for your repository and click **Settings**.

image::solutions-add-bitbucket-solution-bitbucket-settings.png[bitbucket Settings]

Click **Access Keys** then click **Add key**. Add the **public** SSH key you created.

=== Add the Webhook

From the Bitbucket **Settings** page, click **Webhooks** then click **Add webhook**.

Return to the NKS application page, where you will find the Payload URL.

image::solutions-add-bitbucket-solution-deploy-code.png[Deploy the code]

Paste this in to the URL field on Bitbucket. Set the events you want to trigger the webhook, then click **Add webhook** to add it.

=== Trigger the Webhook if Necessary

When you add your webhook, Bitbucket gives you a list of choices for events which trigger the webhook. By default, a repository push is the webhook trigger. If this is the case for your webhook, you will need to do a `git push` to trigger the webhook.

== Check Your Application

At this point everything is configured, although it make take a few minutes for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the process on the Solution's **Metrics** tab.

When the deployment is ready, you can view your application by visiting the ingress URL which NKS automatically created for your application.
